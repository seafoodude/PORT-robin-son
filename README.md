## Installation

The user will have to clone the repo, and in gitbash they will need to install all of the packages "npm i" in the root directory. Then the user will have to run "npm run develop" to run the client application. The client runs on port 3000.

## Usage

Once the user has done "npm run develop" the portfolio will spin up on the browser. The user will be able to see my personal information including my resume, contact info, projects, and experiences.
